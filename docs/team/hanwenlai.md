### Project: OmniHealth

## Overview

OmniHealth aims to provide doctors with a place to store and centrally manage their patientsâ€™ information (eg. medical records, contact information), as well as allowing doctors to schedule appointments, send appointment reminders and other notifications to patients using their stored contact information.
