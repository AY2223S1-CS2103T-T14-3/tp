### Project: OmniHealth

## Overview

OmniHealth aims to provide doctors with a place to store and centrally manage their patientsâ€™ information (eg. medical records, contact information), as well as allowing doctors to schedule appointments, send appointment reminders and other notifications to patients using their stored contact information.

## Summary of Contributions

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=hanwenlai&breakdown=true)

* **Enhancements implemented**:

  * **New Feature**: Added the `rlist` command.
    * What it does: By entering this command (`rlist`) and specifying the index of the patient in the patient list (`PATIENT_INDEX`), the user can view *all* medical records for the specified patient.
    * Justification: The user can get a quick overview of a specific patient's *complete* history of medical records, and then decide what to do next, such as editing or deleting an existing record, or adding a new record.
  
  * **New Feature**: Added the feature where the list of medical records displayed on the GUI is *always* sorted **chronologically**.
    * What it does: The *filtered/unfiltered* list of medical records of a specific patient **will remain sorted chronologically** when displayed on the GUI, even *after* executing commands that manipulate the list of medical records, such as `radd`, `redit` and `rfind`.
    * Justification: This feature will provide a more *systematic and predictable* view of a patient's list of medical records. As a result, the user can easily search for the medical record that they wish to view.
    * Highlights: The list of medical records displayed on the GUI is always sorted in **reverse chronological order**, meaning that the medical records with the *most recent dates appear first*.
  
  * **New Feature**: Added the mandatory `birthdate` field for each patient.
    * What it does: When adding a new patient to the patient list, the user *must* now provide the patient's birthdate. The user can then view the patient's *current age* and birthdate when the **GUI** is displaying the *patient list*.
    * Justification: Since OmniHealth's intended users are doctors, they may readily view any patient's *current age* for purposes such as administering medication or diagnosing a patient's medical condition.
    * Highlights: The displayed age of a patient will be **automatically updated** in relation to the *current date*. As a result, each patient's age *does not* need to be manually updated every year.
  
* **Project management**:
  * Used GitHub issue tracker.
  * Followed the *forking workflow*.

* **Documentation**
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the commands `list` and `rlist`.
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added implementation details for the `rlist` command.
    * Added UML Sequence Diagram showing the execution path of the `rlist` command.

* **Community**:
  * Review/mentoring contributions: Reviewed team members' PRs with helpful responses.

* **Contributions beyond the project team**:
  * Reported [bugs](https://github.com/hanwenlai/ped/issues) in another team's product.
