OmniHealth is a **desktop app for private clinic practitioners to quickly store, edit and search for patients and their records**. It is optimised for use via a **Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 

If you can type fast, OmniHealth can get your patient management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps! ðŸ’Šâœ¨

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `OmniHealth.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T14-3/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for OmniHealth.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

6. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`list`** : Lists all patients.

   * **`add`**`n/John Doe b/14-11-2000 p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a patient named `John Doe` to OmniHealth.

   * **`delete`**`3` : Deletes the 3rd patient shown in the current list.

   * **`clear`** : Deletes all patients.

   * **`rlist 1`** : Lists all the records of the 1st patient shown in the current list.

   * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

7. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/DustAllergy` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `â€¦`â€‹ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]â€¦â€‹` can be used as `Â ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/GlutenAllergy`, `t/DustAllergy t/PollenAllergy` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
