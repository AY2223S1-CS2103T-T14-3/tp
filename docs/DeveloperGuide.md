### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `RecordListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data and display the correct panel.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Record` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data.
  * all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object)
  * all `Record` objects (which are contained in a `RecordList` object)
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* likewise, the currently 'selected' `Record` objects are stored as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Record>` that can be 'observed'.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Implemented\] Add record feature

#### Patient Records
OmniHealth manages patient records generated during patient consultations.  Each `Patient` holds a list of 
medical records that the user is able to modify and edit. The `Record` class encapsulates a medical
record that comprises a date, medical information and medicine prescribed (if any).

#### Implementation

Following the command execution pathway, the implementation of adding records uses the exposed `Model#addRecord(Record)`
operation in the `Model` API which operates through a `DisplayedPerson` which encapsulates the current patient whose list of records is being 
displayed to the user. Record operations are performed through the displayed person, for example,`DisplayedPerson#addRecord(Record)`.
The current patient can be set by `DisplayedPerson#setPerson(Person, AddressBook)`.

The parsing of user input is facilitated by `AddRecordCommandParser`. `AddRecordCommandParser#parse()` parses user 
input string to return a `AddRecordCommand` object with a `Record` derived from the given inputs.

Given below is an example usage scenario.

Precondition. User should be current viewing a specific patient's record list using the `rlist` command. The current
patient is set using `DisplayedPerson#setPerson(Person, AddressBook)`.

Execution. User executes `radd d/01-02-2013 1230 r/Patient developed fever. m/Paracetamol` to add a new record containing 
the date/time of `01-02-2013 1230`, medication remark of `Patient developed fever.` and medication prescription of
`Paracetamol` into the current displayed person's record list. The `radd` command calls `Model#addRecord(Record)` 
which performs the adding of records to the `DisplayedPerson` held by the `Model`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The medication field is an optional input
</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the add record operation works:

![AddRecordCommand](images/AddRecordCommandSequenceDiagram.png)


#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Model-Person Interaction:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use DisplayedPerson as a wrapper class.
    * Pros: Maintain immutability within Person and Model classes, Easy to set current person whose record list is being
displayed
    * Cons: Longer command execution pathway as DisplayedPerson acts as an intermediary class between Model and Person.
  
* **Alternative 2:** Allow model to directly interact with Person's record list.
  * Pros: Easy to implement, simpler command execution pathway.
  * Cons: Potentially violates OOP.
  
### \[Implemented\] Find Records

#### Implementation: 
The find record command mechanism is facilitated by `RecordContainsKeywordPredicate` and `FindRecordCommandParser`
which extends `Predicate` and `AddressbookParser` respectively. 

`FindRecordCommandParser` implements the following operations:
* `FindRecordCommandParser#parse()` - Parses the input arguments by storing each prefix and its respective
values as an `ArgumentMultimap`.

`RecordContainsKeywordPredicate` implements the following operations:
* `RecordContainsKeywordPredicate#test()` - Tests whether the record under testing contains any of the keywords
in the correct fields.

Only `FindRecordCommandParser#parse` is exposed in the Parser interface as Parser#parse().

Given below is an example usage and how the find record mechanism works at each step.

### \[Implemented\] List Records feature

#### Implementation:

The implemented list record mechanism is facilitated by `ListRecordCommandParser`, which extends `AddressBookParser`. `ListRecordCommandParser` implements the following operations:
- `ListRecordCommandParser#parse()` - Parses the input argument into an `Index` and creates a new `ListRecordCommand` object with the parsed `Index`.

The `ListRecordCommand` object then communicates with the `Model` API when it is executed, more specifically, by calling the following methods that are implemented in `ModelManager`:
- `Model#setPersonWithRecords(Person)` - Sets the person whose record list is being displayed (`ModelManager#personWithRecords`) to the given `Person`, so that the displayed record list can be manipulated by calling methods such as `Model#addRecord()` and `Model#deleteRecord()`.
- `Model#setRecordListDisplayed(boolean)` - Setter for a flag to determine if a record list is being displayed; set to `true`.
- `Model#setFilteredRecordList(Person)` - Sets the *filtered list* of records (`ModelManager#filteredRecords`) to the record list of the given Person.
- `Model#updateFilteredRecordList(Predicate)` - Updates the filter of the *filtered list* of records to the filter given by the predicate; an `always true` predicate is given so that all records will be included in the *filtered list*.

At the final step of the execution of the `ListRecordCommand` object, a `CommandResult` object is returned.

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the list record operation works:

![ListRecordCommand](images/ListRecordSequenceDiagram.png)

Example usage scenario:
- Precondition: The user should be viewing the patient list by using the `list` command.
- Execution: The user executes `rlist 1` to list the records of the 1st patient in the displayed patient list.

### \[Implemented\] Clear Records

The clear record command `rclear` allows the application to clear all the existing records in the current active record
list.

#### Implementation:

Given below is an example usage scenario for the command.

**Step 1:** The user launches the application.

**Step 2:** The user executes the `rlist INDEX` command to show the record list of a specified patient. 

**Step 3:** The user executes the `rclear` command to clear all existing records in the record list.

### \[Implemented\] Add appointment

The add appointment feature allows Omnihealth to manage future appointments for patients. Each `Patient` holds an appointment
reference for record keeping that the user is able to edit and clear.

The feature currently does not support automatic removal of appointments which dates have passed, and require a new appointment
to override the old appointment or for the existing appointment to be cleared with the `apptcl` command.

#### Implementation:
The add appointment command mechanism is facilitated by the `AddAppointmentCommandParser` class which extends the `AddressbookParser`.

`AddAppointmentParser` implements the following operations:
* `AddAppointmentParser#parse()` - Parses the input arguments by storing the index and the prefix of its respective values as 
an `ArgumentMultimap.`

`AddAppointmentParser#parse()` is exposed in the Parser interface as Parser#parse().

Given below is an example usage scenario for the command.

**Step 1:** The user launches the application.

**Step 2:** The user executes the `appt INDEX d/ dd-MM-yyyy` command in the CLI.

**Step 3:** An appointment will be assigned to the patient specified with the index input.

### \[Implemented\] Clear appointment

#### Implementation:
The add appointment mechanism is facilitated by `ClearAppointmentCommandParser`  which extends `AddressbookParser`.

`ClearAppointmentParser` implements the following operations:
* `ClearAppointmentParser#parse()` - Parses the input arguments by storing the index and the prefix of its respective values as
  an `ArgumentMultimap.`

`ClearAppointmentParser#parse()` is exposed in the Parser interface as Parser#parse().

Given below is an example usage scenario for the command.

**Step 1:** The user launches the application.

**Step 2:** The user executes the `apptcl INDEX ` command in the CLI.

**Step 3:** The patient's appointment(if any) will be cleared. 

### \[Proposed\] Upcoming appointment tracker

The proposed upcoming appointment feature will be a display to show upcoming appointments for the user upon application start.

#### Proposed Implementation
The proposed implementation is facilitated by `AppointmentWindow`. It extends `UiPart<Stage>` with a new window.

Given below is an example usage scenario for the command.

**Step 1:** The user launches the application.

**Step 2:** A additional window appears, showing the current upcoming appointments.

### \[Implemented\] Delete Records feature

#### Implementation:
The delete record mechanism is facilitated by `DeleteRecordCommandParser`  which extends `AddressbookParser`.

`DeleteRecordCommandParser` implements the following operations:
* `DeleteRecordCommandParser#parse()` - Parses the input argument into an `Index` and 
creates a new `DeleteRecordCommand` object with the parsed `Index`.

The `DeleteRecordCommand` object then communicates with the `Model` API when it is executed, more specifically, by calling the following methods that are implemented in `ModelManager`:
* `Model#getFilteredRecordList()` - Returns the record list which is displayed.
* `Model#isRecordListDisplayed()` - Returns a boolean result if a record list is being displayed.
* `Model#deleteRecord(Record)` - Deletes the input record from the DisplayedPerson (`Model#personWithRecords`).

Given below is an example usage scenario for the command.

* Precondition: 
  * User should be current viewing a specific patient's record list using the `rlist` command. 
  * The current patient is set using `DisplayedPerson#setPerson(Person, AddressBook)`.

* Execution: 
  * User executes `rdelete 1` to delete the 1st record in the displayed record list. The `rdelete` command calls `Model#deleteRecord(Record)` which performs the deletion of records from the `DisplayedPerson` held by the `Model`.

### \[Implemented\] Edit Records feature

#### Implementation:
The edit record mechanism is facilitated by `EditRecordCommandParser`  which extends `AddressbookParser`.

`EditRecordCommandParser` implements the following operations:
* `EditRecordCommandParser#parse()` - Parses the input argument by storing the index and respective prefix as in `ArgumentMultimap`

The `EditRecordCommand` object then calls `createEditedRecord` and communicates with the `EditRecordDescriptor` to create 
a new `editedRecord` to replace the `Record` that is to be edited.

The `EditRecordCommand` object then communicates with the `Model` API when it is executed, more specifically,
by calling the following methods that are implemented in `ModelManager`:
* `Model#setRecord(Record, Record)` - Sets the target record of `Model#personWithRecords` to the new edited record.
* `Model#updateFilteredRecordList(Predicate<Record>)` - Updates the filter of the filtered record list to filter by the given predicate;
in this case, show all the records.

Given below is an example usage scenario for the command.

* Precondition:
    * User should be current viewing a specific patient's record list using the `rlist` command.
    * The current patient is set using `DisplayedPerson#setPerson(Person, AddressBook)`.

* Execution:
    * User executes `redit 1 r/Fever d/12-12-2012 1200 m/` to set the 1st record in the displayed record list to a new
  record containing the date/time of `12-12-2012 1200`, record data of `Fever` and sets the medications to empty.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts
* private clinic practitioners who do not have access to general health service management applications like Healthhub
* private clinic practitioners of clinics who still utilise physical paper records to store patient information

**Value proposition**:
* provide doctors with a place to **store and centrally manage their patientsâ€™ information**
* allow doctors to schedule appointments, send appointment reminders and other notifications (eg. medication, payment
  information) to patients using their stored contact information.
